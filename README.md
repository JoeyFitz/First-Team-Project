# Inspiration Station
## Description
This repo contains the source code for a web-based application that can create and curate collections of inspirational and humorous digital content. It was developed by a team of four prospective full-stack developers as part of a coding bootcamp assignment. This application pulls in data, in the form of videos, images, and quotes, from various publically-available web APIs. We were motivated to develop this application given all the challenges surrounding us, in an out of this course, and the need to get good vibes on demand. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we did developing it!
